Other Games

Rivals of Aether

Rivals of Aether is an indie fighting game that is very similar to smash in many ways. Although Rivals may not be the most popular game at Cornell Smash, you can feel free to bring your own setup and come and play Rivals with others! Whenever someone brings Rivals to our meetings, people love to come try it out and play it!

Other Fighting Games

Cornell Smash is primarily for Smash Melee and Ultimate, and if you're interested in playing any other fighting games or competitive esports, we heavily suggest you go check out [Cornell Esports](https://discord.gg/jaxjpBrxUu). If you would like to bring your own setup to meetings for other fighting games, we will glady accept and play them, but know that Smash is our clubs focus.
